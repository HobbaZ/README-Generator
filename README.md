## Description
 
  <h3>Project Aim</h3>

  The aim of this project was to create a professional README generator.
  Which you can [view here](https://github.com/HobbaZ/README-Generator)

  <h3>What Problem Does It Solve</h3>

  The generator enables you to produce more efficient README documentation, spending less time on documentation and 
  more time on making your project come to life. With sections for the repo title, project description, installation, user story, screenshots, contributors sections and more,
  it'll give you that professional README look straight out of the box, of course you can also add and remove sections as you like.

  <h3>What I Learnt</h3>

  in making this project, I learnt how to use Node.js, string literals, inquirer and validating inputs.

## User Story

  As A USER I Want a program that helps me create readme documentation quickly by generating sections with my desired input.

  WHEN I run the program in Terminal

  THEN I am prompted to enter information about my project, section by section.

  WHEN I finish inputting my information

  THEN a README file is generated with a basic professional layout.
